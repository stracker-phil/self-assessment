# React Development

> Front-end topic, proof for "**React.js - Generic**, outside of the context of WordPress"

## Overview

The featured React project showcases component architecture, state management, and UI development practices. While still under active development, the codebase demonstrates initial architectural decisions, Redux store implementation, and established coding standards. The work represents a complex customer project developed under a tight delivery deadline.

## Context

- Note on the category: This proof _IS_ a WordPress integration, but I've chosen the "generic" section, as there was no "React inside WordPress" option. This category should clarify that it's not a _Block integration_.
- This project is still in progress, and some code needs clean-up
- The linked repo is owned by WooCommerce, but publicly available
