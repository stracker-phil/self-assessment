# General PHP Architecture

> Back-end topic, proof for "**PHP - Generic**, outside the context of WordPress"

## Overview

This proof presents a WordPress plugin built with modern PHP practices. The implementation follows a Symfony-inspired architecture, using object-oriented design principles, dependency management, and clean code practices.

## Context

- The plugin serves as an example of how I write code from scratch; it's specifically an _assessment repo_ and not a real-world project.
- I also choose this same project as the [JS in WordPress](../frontend-wp/README.md) proof, as I believe showcasing a single full-stack sample gives a better impression of my skills.
