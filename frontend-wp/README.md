## Context


- I also choose this same project as the [PHP Architecture](../php-arch/README.md) proof, as I believe showcasing a single full-stack sample gives a better impression of my skills.
- The React implementation shown here provides additional context for the [React Development](../react-ui/README.md) proof, though that section focuses on different aspects of React development.
